# Coding's surviving gates, exercised as real subprocesses.
#
# History (issue-64 remediation): this file used to shell out to
# record-fields-gate.sh and trailer-gate.sh under coding/hooks/ — both were
# deleted when coding's record/commit checks were consolidated (issue-61's
# proposal flagged this exact staleness and deferred the fix to this issue).
# record-fields-gate.sh's job (required record fields/headings) now lives in
# record-shape-gate.sh, targeting docs/issue-<n>/reports/implementation.md —
# repointed below, same allow/deny intent, new gate and path.
# trailer-gate.sh's job (require a `Subject: issue-<n>` commit trailer) has
# no successor anywhere in this repo: contract v3's own specs
# (docs/specs/*.md) no longer state that requirement, and no gate reads a
# commit message for it. Resurrecting a trailer check here would invent
# behavior the current contract does not ask for, so those three cases are
# retired rather than repointed.
