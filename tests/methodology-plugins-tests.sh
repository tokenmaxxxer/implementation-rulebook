COMPLETE_PROPOSAL='files:
  - src/example.py

## Request
Do the thing.

## Constraints
Keep it small.

## Rationale
We considered a queue-based approach rather than a direct call, and rejected it because it added latency for no benefit here.

## What will be done
Write the function.

## Out of scope
Nothing else.

## How you'\''ll know it worked
Tests pass.'

MISSING_RATIONALE='files:

## Request

## How you'\''ll know it worked

SKIP_STATED='files:
  - src/example.py

## Request
Do the thing.

## Constraints
Keep it small.

## Rationale
Pure bugfix, no design decision to weigh; survey skipped per scout-directive skip condition.

## What will be done
Write the function.

## Out of scope
Nothing else.

## How you'\''ll know it worked
Tests pass.'
