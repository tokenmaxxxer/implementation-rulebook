# tokenmaxxxer / implementation-rulebook

The `coding` role on contract v3. A coding session is spawned with two
plugin sets installed: this marketplace's plugins (`coding`, the steering
trio `blueprint`, `no-mock`, `no-footgun`, and the methodology trio
`proposal-shape`, `record-shape`, `survey-order`), and the
[tokenmaxxxer-core](https://github.com/tokenmaxxxer/tokenmaxxxer-core)
plugins (`core`, `terse`, `freelunch`, `scout`). Core owns the interaction
protocol — issue in, two-phase PR out (research/survey/proposal → human
review Approve → execution), branch `issue-<n>/implementation`, record at
`docs/issue-<n>/reports/implementation.md`. (The plugin directory is still
named `coding` — a deliberate, tracked naming doubling with the
`implementation` role name used everywhere else; see
`coding/hooks/directive.sh`.)

The stack's thesis is unchanged: **the generation layer generates;
verification lives elsewhere** — with qa, review, verify, and the human's
PR review. terse, freelunch, and scout were promoted to the core
marketplace (they are role-agnostic); dispatch retired (contract v3 IS
dispatch, mechanized); warrant's proposal-freeze/approval machinery
retired (core's approval-gate owns the human gate); doctrine's placement
gates retired (core's board-gate R1 owns layout). The full position paper
remains at [docs/reports/generation-is-all-you-need.md](docs/reports/generation-is-all-you-need.md).

## What is here

    coding/hooks/directive.sh           SessionStart — the four facets:
                                        codebase/ecosystem research, write-set
                                        survey (a new dep or env var is a
                                        decision), build-proposal fields,
                                        judgment (scope-exceeded stop rule,
                                        honest claims, "What did not work",
                                        placement ladder, hunt cadence)
    coding/hooks/state.sh               SessionStart — rebuilds open-unit
                                        context from the issue branch + PR
                                        review state
    coding/hooks/coding-progress-gate.sh  s15: a blocking verify finding
                                        blocks build commits until a
                                        resolved_findings entry (sha
                                        adjacent to the finding's own id or
                                        verify.md mention) + finder re-clear;

## Record vocabulary

`loop_state`: `coding, commit-unreachable, committing, landed,
scope-undeclared` (per `implementation.spec.json`; terminal: `landed`).
Signals: commit shas landed, `resolved_findings:` naming the finder path
and finder-record sha, `## What did not work`.

Required deliverable fields on a phase-2 record, per
`implementation.spec.json`:

- `commit_sha` — realized in this rulebook as the existing
  `code_under_review:` frontmatter key (same concept, established
  spelling; not renamed — see `docs/issue-75/proposals/
  2026-08-09-spec-field-loop-state-alignment.md`).
- `type` — free-text (e.g. `docs`, `feat`, `fix`), record-shape frontmatter.
- `breaking` — boolean, record-shape frontmatter.
- `verdict` — e.g. `pass`, `fail`, `unverifiable`, record-shape
  frontmatter; the no-mock directive's "run it once, state the outcome
  honestly" step lands here.

## Install

    claude plugin marketplace add tokenmaxxxer/implementation-rulebook
    claude plugin install coding@tokenmaxxxer-coding

Kill switches: `CODING_CYCLE_OFF=1` (coding's directive/state), `WARRANT_OFF=1`
(the rotating hunter), `WARRANT_HUNT_MAX` (session dispatch cap, default 3),
`PROPOSAL_SHAPE_OFF=1` + `PROPOSAL_SHAPE_GATE_OFF=1` (proposal-shape's
directive and gate respectively), `RECORD_SHAPE_OFF=1` +
`RECORD_SHAPE_GATE_OFF=1` (record-shape's directive and gate), and
`SURVEY_ORDER_OFF=1` + `SURVEY_ORDER_GATE_OFF=1` (survey-order's directive
and gate).

## Run the checks

All five gates (`coding-progress-gate.sh`, `proposal-shape-gate.sh`,
`record-shape-gate.sh`, `survey-order-gate.sh`, plus `hunt-guard.sh`/
`hunt-state.sh`/`state.sh`) source core's gate-house standard
(`core/hooks/lib/gate-lib.sh`/`gate-lib.py`, issue #72) — reference only,
never vendored (`docs/handbooks/gate-tests.md`). Set
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT_CORE` to your `tokenmaxxxer-core` checkout's `core/`
directory before running these locally; a real plugin-marketplace install
resolves it automatically.
